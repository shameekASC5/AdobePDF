This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is part of the XPS2PDF conversion engine. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure."
CVE-2017-16385,"An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The vulnerability is caused by a buffer access with an incorrect length value in TIFF parsing during XPS conversion. Crafted TIFF image input causes a mismatch between allocated buffer size and the access allowed by the computation. If an attacker can adequately control the accessible memory then this vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution."

NOTE: the vendor has stated that the reporter refused to provide sufficient details to confirm the issue. In addition, due to the lack of details in the original advisory, an independent verification is not possible. Finally, the reliability of the original reporter is unknown. This item has only been assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes, and to serve as a concrete example of the newly defined UNVERIFIABLE and PRERELEASE content decisions in CVE, which must be discussed by the Editorial Board. Without additional details or independent verification by reliable sources, it is highly likely that this item will be REJECTED."
